# Estimate Delta V and Damage Severity

Use a CNN to estimate what Delta V should be from using images of rear end accidents. I used images for the vehicle that was hit and excluded other vehicles.

Steps:

1. `get_RearEndAccidents.py`

2. `get_images.py`

3. `identify_rearended_vehicle.py`

4. `preprocess_images.py`

5. `Multi Input NNet.py` and `Train NNet.py` (if desired)

6. `LoadModel.py`
